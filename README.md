## Platinum Motors Web Scraper

<p>This application works in tandem with the currently in development mobile application for Platinum Motors. This is a python script that creates a flask server and scrapes information that will be used in the mobile application.</p>
<p>To get the server working, run the file 'webScrapeServer.py' and it will create an API that can be accessed from localhost.</p>
<p>This tool aids us in the development process until we get full access to the car database.</p>
